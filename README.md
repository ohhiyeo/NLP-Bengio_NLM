# NLP-Bengio_NN
This code implements Bengio et al.'s 2003 neural language model.  

We run the code on Google Colab.  
How to run:  
1. Open google colab in the browser, click File -> Upload Notebook -> choose Bengio_NN.ipynb  
2. The "Training with Stochastic Gradient Descent" takes about 5 hours per epoch  
3. If you do not have time to train the network yourself, the pretrained model that have been trained for 4 epochs is available. (bengio-nn.pickle)  
4. To upload pretrained model, run block 18, upload bengio-nn.pickle  
5. Then you can continue run the cosine similarity function and spearman's $`\rho`$
